# SC-shapes-the-maturation-of-cortical-morphology
This repository provides core code and relevant toolboxes for data analysis in the article "Liang X, Sun L, Liao X, Lei T, Xia M, Duan D, Zeng Z, Xu Z, Men W, Wang Y, Tan S, Gao J, Qin S, Tao S, Dong Q, Zhao T, He Y, Structural connectome architecture shapes the maturation of cortical morphology from childhood to adolescence. bioRxiv, 2022, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.15.520527v2"

## Overview:

Content includes standalone software, source code, and demo data. All data required for reproducing our findings have been made publicly available, including regional cortical thickness matrix, structural connectivity matrix in three node parcellation resolutions for each participant, intermediate results during analysis, and data for visualizing the main figures. Raw data is available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request. Of note, due to limitation of data size, some data is placed in another public cloud storage: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hVJKoSD4vTon8ERw8PuyB1SQGCkaqfFg?usp=drive_link
## Installation guide:

Please use the “add path” method in MATLAB, "pip install" method in Python and "install.packages()" method in R to add toolboxes and scripts in the code folder. These procedures are not time-consuming.

## Code:

Following five analyses were performed using open-source packages:
1. **Spin test**: The spin test was conducted using an open Matlab code package (https://github.com/frantisekvasa/rotate_parcellation) (1, 2).

2. **Rewired test**: Surrogate networks that preserve the nodal degree and approximate edge length distribution of the empirical network were generated using a Matlab code package (https://www.brainnetworkslab.com/coderesources) (3). 

3. **Group SC generation**: Group-level connectome backbone was generated by using a consensus approach that preserves the connection length distributions of individual networks (https://www.brainnetworkslab.com/coderesources) (4).

4. **SVR model**: The cortical thickness (CT) maturation degree was predicted with an SVR model using an open Matlab code package (https://github.com/ZaixuCui/Pattern_Regression_Clean/tree/master/SVR) (5) and LIBSVM matlab toolbox (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).

5. **Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis**: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was conducted using the ToppGene Suite (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/) (6).
6. **Visualization**: BrainNet Viewer (www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv) and netneurotools (https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools) toolbox.

The main analysis process was performed step-by-step using the following code.
1. **Mixed linear model**: s1_mixed_model_group_diff.m

2. **White matter network constraints on the spatial maturation of cortical thickness**: s2_Liang_corrNeighborCT.m s3_Liang_corrNeighborCT_system.m

3. **Generalized additive models were used to fit the maturation curves of nodal CT with age** : s4_GAM.R 

4. **Longitudinal analysis**: s5_lxy_sc_corr_longitudinal.m

5. **Random walk model**: s6_Liang_ramdom_walk.m

6. **Computing transcription level differences for 4 neurodevelopmental gene sets (7) between dominant and non-dominant regions**: s7_BrainSpan_dominant.m

7. **Preprocessing of AHBA gene expression data**: The regional microarray expression data were preprocessed using a recommended pipeline with the abagen toolbox (0.1.3) (https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen) (8, 9).
    s8_AHBA_gene_expression.py

    Custom code and toolboxes were tested on a 64-bit Windows 10 PC (Intel Core i7-9700, 56GB RAM). Data was analyzed using Matlab 2018b, Python 3.7.12, and R 3.6.3. We thank the authors and developers for providing these wonderful tools for data analysis.
